# Multithreaded-Chatroom
A simple multithreaded chatroom containing comments explaining what the hell is goin on fully, along with commentless versions to just view the code.
Most of this was created in one evening, and the comments later that evening, so if you spot anything that doesn't work, is missing, or isn't explained well hit me up here or on reddit (/u/Tobiky) and I will fix it as soon as possible!
